# npm resolution error report

While resolving: codewonders@1.5.0
Found: react@18.2.0
node_modules/react
  react@"18.2.0" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer react@"^15.6.2 || ^16.0" from react-ga@2.7.0
node_modules/react-ga
  react-ga@"^2.7.0" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
